The first program is for creating an interface that helps manage different banks. It has an interface that contains two methods getBalance and getInterest.
There are three banks that implement this interface each of these banks have a different rate of interst
Bank A - 7% of balance.
Bank B - 7.4% of balance.
Bank C - 7.9% of balance.

The second program is to calculate the total amount of water that can be trapped within a cityscape. The logic is we find a maxLeft and a maxRight from each point of the array and then  return the min between the maximums. Then we subract the min between these from the current idx of the array and incase it is a negative number we return a 0. This is how much water a particular block can store. This is how this problem is solved.
